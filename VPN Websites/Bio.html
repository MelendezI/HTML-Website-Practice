							<p>Hello, my name is Ismael Melendez, and I am a dedicated student at Thaddeus Stevens College of Technology, majoring in Computer Science.
							From a young age, I have been fascinated by technology and computers. I love to dismantle and build electronics and systems just for an
							understanding of how they work.</p>
							
							<p>My ultimate career goal is to excel in the field of cybersecurity, but the overall goal is to build a career path towards computer science.
							I believe it's useless to not be actively engaged in projects or continuous learning. What I think distinguishes me from my peers is my mindset
							and relentless determination and drive to overcome an obstacle regardless of size or complexity. Giving up is not an option to me, no matter
							the challenge.</p>
							
							<p>When I am not breaking down a computer or network, you can often find me indulging in my hobbies for gaming and gym. Additionally, I'm a well
							talented graphic designer and aspire to establish my own graphic design company in the future, once I'm more established with a career,
							using graphic design not only as a creative outlet but also as a source of passive income. What makes me a graphic designer is my expertise
							spans various areas, including printmaking, creating business cards, logos, posters, and more.</p>
